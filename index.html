    <ol>
      <li><strong>Client Success Stories:</strong><br>
<p>
    Throughout my career, I've consistently contributed to client satisfaction and retention, yielding significant economic gains. A standout example from my time at Stova involved resolving a critical website layout issue for a high-value client's live event. As the sole resource available on a weekend, I swiftly applied my web development skills to provide a custom solution that not only saved the event but also delighted the client.

</p>
       
</li>

      <li><strong>Leadership and Team Development:</strong><br>
       <p>
    I've taken on leadership roles in various instances, with formal leadership experience in my last two organizations. At UA Brands, I stepped into a managerial role after in the absence of one. I successfully managed a team of over 15 individuals, overseeing every queue to meet SLAs, suggesting improvements in individual performances, and establishing and enforcing policies. Additionally, I created a Macro tool to address the absence of ad-hoc work measurement, ensuring accurate productivity for a fail employee assessment. I actively sought feedback to enhance the tool's user-friendliness, ensuring that my team faced no additional pressure while using it. In Stova, I taught my teammates with knowledge of better ways of handling clients and the choice of words during formal conversations. I came up with an idea of using the available resources to their fullest, thus added several add-ons on MS Teams for collecting data in more collaborative and interactive ways and automating some daily work with accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    My journey in leadership and team development has been marked by a consistent drive to inspire, guide, and innovate. Whether it was stepping into a managerial role at UA Brands during a time of transition or enhancing team performance at Stova, I have continuously sought opportunities to empower my colleagues and optimize operations. Through my leadership, I have nurtured a culture of growth, efficiency, and collaboration, resulting in improved performance metrics, enhanced customer experiences, and a more cohesive team dynamic. My ability to lead by example, foster open communication, and drive meaningful change has been instrumental in achieving positive outcomes and solidifying my reputation as a dependable leader. I am excited to bring my leadership skills and dedication to future endeavors, where I can continue to shape high-performing teams and deliver exceptional results.
</p>

</li>

      <li><strong>Process Improvements:</strong><br>

<p>
    At Tech Mahindra, I introduced an innovative process improvement in the Bold Chat software, which had a profound impact on the team handling clients for three Global UK telecom companies. This creative solution not only enhanced my own performance but also benefited the entire team. By sharing this new feature, we managed to significantly reduce the average handling time for one chat, reducing it from 17 minutes per client to just 8 minutes. This remarkable improvement enabled our chat team to handle more than double the number of clients within the same time frame, resulting in increased customer satisfaction, improved SLA adherence, and substantial profits for the company. Furthermore, this initiative consistently positioned me as a leader in NPS (Net Promoter Score) rankings. In Stova, I discovered a similar tool that led individuals to type an entire frequently used template in microseconds.
</p>

<p>
    These experiences underscore my commitment to driving innovation and efficiency. My ability to identify opportunities for improvement, develop creative solutions, and share these advancements with my team has not only delivered tangible results but also positioned me as a catalyst for positive change. I take pride in my dedication to enhancing processes, exceeding performance metrics, and ultimately contributing to the overall success and profitability of my employers. I look forward to bringing this same level of commitment and innovation to future challenges and opportunities, ensuring continued growth and excellence.
</p>

</li>

      <li><strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong><br>

    Throughout my career, I have consistently ranked at the top in Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) measurements and Net Promoter Score (NPS) rankings. My dedication to ensuring client happiness has not only been personally rewarding but has also been recognized and rewarded by every company I've had the privilege to work with.
